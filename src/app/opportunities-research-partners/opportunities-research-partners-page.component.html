    <section>
      <p>
        Do you want to take an active role in combating coordinated online abuse that targets African women journalists,
        election candidates or other human rights defenders ?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Code for Africa (CfA)</b> in partnership with <b>Jigsaw</b>, is offering research grants and technical
        support for evidence-driven analysis into how malign actors coordinate harassment and complaints against African
        women journalists and fact-checkers across 21 African countries. The countries covered in this programme are:
        Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic
        (CAR), Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger,
        Nigeria,
        Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.
      </p>

      <p>
        The research fellowships come with a financial stipend, along with access to CfA’s in-house research desk, as
        well as
        forensic analysts, data scientists and open source intelligence (OSINT) researchers, and machine learning tools
        for
        social listening or data/network analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The research fellows will compile evidence about online gender-based harassment into substantive public research
        reports
        that shines new light on the actors, networks and motives behind the online harassment and how it undermines
        public
        participation of marginalised groups on the African continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Selected fellows will be invited to share their research at seminars or international events.
      </p>
      <h4>Why is CfA offering research grants?</h4>
      <p>
        Detailed evidence and/or actionable insights about how online gender based harassment is coordinated is scarce
        in
        Africa. This hampers traditional civil society watchdogs and media from proactively exposing these activities
        and
        mobilising for fairer societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fellows’ research is therefore intended to not only help African media and CSOs understand online
        gender-based
        harassment in their country/region, but to establish ways in which they can combat the harassment.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Research formats:
      </h4>
      <p>
        Grant recipients will be required to publish their findings on free-to-access platforms. CfA is therefore most
        interested in research proposals that aim to produce any of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Series of short reports modelled on journalistic analysis (see examples elsewhere on the <a
            href="https://disinfo.africa/" target="_blank">ADDO website</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Datasets containing actionable information or lexicons or watchlists for researchers, media or CSOs to use for
          their own
          analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Presentations designed to showcase research at conferences or to peer groups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Academically-focussed preprint or peer reviewed papers for public feedback and citation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>
        Where will my research be published?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Fellows’ research output will be published with their home institutions, as well as on this site. CfA will also
        collaborate with research partners to identify and publish in relevant high-impact, mass-audience media or
        industry
        journals. Research can also be published as pre-print papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the research output, and the report format, the fellows may present their findings at public events
        or on
        broadcast media (as guest speakers) rather than in print media. As a principle, CfA will strive for syndication
        or
        multiple publications, to maximise impact.
      </p>

      <h4>Who can apply?</h4>
      <p>
        Individuals or small teams that work in African countries, or that are affiliated with African-based partners
        can apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        All applications will be evaluated by an internal review committee.
      </p>

      <h4>Evaluation criteria</h4>

      <p>
        This call-for-proposals is intended to be a fast-track and lightweight support mechanism for researchers.
        Proposals that
        focus on generating rapid and/or iterative outputs will be prioritised for this initial call (future calls will
        accommodate more complex or longer research projects). Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          25 <i>points</i>: <b>The strength of the research topic and supporting evidence.</b> Does it address issues on
          online gender based
          harassment; does it offer fresh insights/evidence that will aid civic watchdogs; is the evidence accessible
          and
          compelling?
        </li>
        <li>
          25 <i>points</i>: <b>The capacity/expertise of the researcher/team.</b> Does the researcher have demonstrable
          technical expertise or
          domain knowledge; is there clear commitment to global best-practices for research ethics/data management?
        </li>
        <li>
          20 <i>points</i>: <b>The feasibility of the proposal.</b> Is the research topic and methodology feasible
          within the proposed project
          timelines, budget, methodology and research capacity?
        </li>
        <li>
          15 <i>points</i>: <b>The envisioned format for the research outputs.</b> Will the proposed format/s be widely
          accessible for civic
          watchdogs such as the media and CSOs and other researchers; will the research package include data or other
          evidence for
          watchdogs to analyse; will the research format be appropriate for some form of peer review?
        </li>
        <li>
          15 <i>points</i>: <b>Commitment to knowledge sharing.</b> Does the researcher have a track-record for sharing
          technical insights on
          methodologies/technologies used in the analysis; is there a commitment to transforming the research and/or
          methodology
          into replicable resources; is there a commitment to open data, open knowledge standards?
        </li>
