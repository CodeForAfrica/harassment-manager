      <p>Do trolls invade your timeline all too often? Want to filter them out before you read them?</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="/">FeedShield</a></b>, a tool developed by <a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/"
          target="_blank"><b>Jigsaw</b></a> and implemented by <a href="https://codeforafrica.org"><b>Code for Africa
            (CfA)</b></a>, allows you to do just that. With FieldShield, you can sort your mentions based on how likely
        they are to be toxic or harmful. You can then package
        together harmful posts to send to social media support teams so they can take action against toxic accounts and
        trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of our launch, we are offering fellowships to women journalists and fact-checkers across a number of
        African
        countries who want to be some of the first users to roll out this new tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re looking for early adopters in one of these countries, who will be part of the first roll out: Burkina
        Faso,
        Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
        (DRC),
        Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan,
        Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with access to the tool, the chosen fellows will receive a financial stipend and access to CfA’s
        investigative
        team who, if the fellow wants, can investigate if the harassment they experience is coordinated.
      </p>

      <p>
        In return, fellows will need to document their journey as <b>FeedShield’s</b>'early adopters’, demonstrating
        the tool’s
        effectiveness to their followers and networks.
      </p>

      <p>
