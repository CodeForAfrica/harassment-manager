                The Tool may detect personal data, including some special category data, when looking for incidences of
                harassment.
                However, this information is only visible to the user and is not stored in the Tool - with the exception
                of
                draft
                reports, which are an aggregation of public comments from Twitter, stored on Google Sheets and may be
                accessible to a
                limited number of developers with specific permissions. The in-progress report is deleted from the
                database
                once you
                have completed the report or abandoned it.
