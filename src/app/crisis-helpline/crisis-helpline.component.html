              Need help? FeedShield offers a virtual helpline for people facing online harassment to talk to trained
              crisis counsellors, who will help connect users with local experts or support organisations. The helpline
              is run by a trauma CSO based in Kenya, and can currently only support callers in English. FeedShield will
              add artners who can assist in other international languages such as Arabic and French in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
              Counsellors will treat your call as confidential, protecting all your personal information, and will only
              share your details with our other support teams if you explicitly request them to in writing.

                *Though a counselling service, the virtual helpline is not an emergency service. If you are in imminent
                danger, if
                someone is threatening you with physical violence online or it escalates, take the following steps to
                ensure your
                safety:

                <li>Do not engage any further with the person that is threatening you</li>
