      Women journalists and other public figures in Africa are routinely targeted in coordinated attacks by online
      trolls.
      Trolls flood their target's social feeds with demeaning or threatening content as a way of drowning out or
      silencing women's voices on sensitive topics.</p>
    <p>
      FeedShield is an online toolkit to help human rights defenders turn the tide, by documenting the abuse and
      unmasking the trolls.

      <mat-panel-title>How does FeedShield work?</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      FeedShield syncs with your Twitter account and uses machine learning technology to identify abusive comments.
      The tool rates each comment with a toxicity score and lets you take action - by muting or blocking accounts in
      bulk - without having to read the abusive messages. While all comments are automatically hidden, you can unhide
      them if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>You can also collate harmful comments into a single report. This report can be downloaded and shared with
      Twitter and other trusted third parties as needed.</p>
    <p>
      Abusive accounts will not know that they have been featured in a report. No third party - including Code for
      Africa and Twitter - will be able to access any of the reports you create, unless shared directly with them.
      Draft reports are temporarily stored in the tool to enable you to complete them. Once downloaded or abandoned,
      the report will be deleted from FeedShield.

    <p>
      Yes, your data is kept private when you use FeedShield. We only collect essential information such as your name
      and
      email address, and we will never share your personal data with third parties without your consent. We only use
      your
      personal data for the purpose for which it was collected.
