        Why do I have to register to use FeedShield?
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      By registering, you’ll help us understand who is using the tool, so we can
      constantly improve FeedShield’s capabilities to suit your needs.

      <mat-panel-title>How does FeedShield work?</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      FeedShield syncs with your Twitter account and uses machine learning technology to identify abusive comments.
      The tool rates each comment with a toxicity score and lets you take action - by muting or blocking accounts in
      bulk - without having to read the abusive messages. While all comments are automatically hidden, you can unhide
      them if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>You can also collate harmful comments into a single report. This report can be downloaded and shared with
      Twitter and other trusted third parties as needed.</p>
    <p>
      Abusive accounts will not know that they have been featured in a report. No third party - including Code for
      Africa and Twitter - will be able to access any of the reports you create, unless shared directly with them.
      Draft reports are temporarily stored in the tool to enable you to complete them. Once downloaded or abandoned,
      the report will be deleted from FeedShield.

    <p>
      Yes, your data is kept private when you use FeedShield. We only collect essential information such as your name
      and
      email address, and we will never share your personal data with third parties without your consent. We only use
      your
      personal data for the purpose for which it was collected.

    <p>
      FeedShield will initially tackle trolling on Twitter, with other social media platforms added as access to the
      relevant
      data becomes available. CfA’s initial launch will focus on Kenya, and will expand to offer support to users
      elsewhere in
      Africa from 2023. Arabic and Francophone versions of the tool will launch in 2023.
