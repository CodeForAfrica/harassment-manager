    <p>
      By registering, you’ll help us understand who is using the tool, so we can
      constantly improve SafeNet’s capabilities to suit your needs.

      You can check out our

      <mat-panel-title>How does SafeNet work?</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      SafeNet syncs with the user’s Twitter account and uses machine learning
      technology to identify abusive comments, providing toxicity scores and
      enabling the user to take action - through muting or blocking accounts in
      bulk - without reviewing the content. Users have the ability to unhide the
      comments if they wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users also have the option to create records of harassment and download a
      report, which can be shared with trusted third parties as needed. Users
      can choose to include all the abusive content and accounts that the tool
      has identified as being harmful, or customise their selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abusive accounts will not know that they have been featured in a report
      and no third party - including Code for Africa, Twitter and Jigsaw - will
      access the report generated in the tool. Draft reports are temporarily
      stored in the tool to enable you to complete them. Once downloaded or
      abandoned, the report will be deleted from SafeNet.
