          Why do I have to register to use SafeNet?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>By registering, you’ll help us understand who is using the tool, so we can constantly improve SafeNet’s
        capabilities to suit your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check out our <a class="page-link" href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy </a> to learn more about which
        personal information we collect and how it's protected.

          How does SafeNet work?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>SafeNet syncs with the user’s Twitter account and uses machine learning technology to identify abusive
        comments, providing toxicity scores and enabling the user to take action - through muting or blocking accounts
        in
        bulk - without reviewing the content. Users have the ability to unhide the comments if they wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users also have the option to create records of harassment and download a report, which can be shared with
        trusted
        third parties as needed. Users can choose to include all the abusive content and accounts that the tool has
        identified as being harmful, or customise their selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abusive accounts will not know that they have been featured in a report and no third party - including Code for
        Africa, Twitter and Jigsaw - will access the report generated in the tool. Draft reports are temporarily stored
        in
        the tool to enable you to complete them. Once downloaded or abandoned, the report will be deleted from SafeNet.
